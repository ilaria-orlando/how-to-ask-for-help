# How to ask for help
## A guide for finding the help you need

 ### 1.Analyse
+ Try to break up your code in parts to pinpoint where the problem is. Look for faults in your code,
maybe you forgot a quotation mark or a semicollon? Your IDE will sometimes already show you where there is a problem via colors.
+ In case you cannot find it yourself: use a debugger, for example when using html use the html validator.
+ Write down some key tags and try to get the structure of your project on paper.
+ Rubber duck method: Buy a rubber duck, in the color of your choice. Put it on your desk and explain your code to it. ;)

 ### 2. Research
+ Google it! this is also a good practice to draft some test questions based on your error-analysis. Those questions should be shorter than
the ones you would ask a colleague for example, but they might point you in the right direction.
+ Bookmark some interesting topics which you might find useful in other cases in case it's not exactly the answer you're looking for.

 ### 3.Specifications
+ #### What
    + What language?
    + Which editor?
    + What unwanted result did you get?
    + What is the goal you want to achieve?
    + What steps did you already undertake in the quest to find a solution?
    + Select relevant code you want to copy/paste.
    + Try and think of appropriate tags.

+ #### Where
    + Face to face, showing on your computer
    + Company communication tools
    + Mail

+ #### Who
    + Peers
    + Superior
    + Online on fora when your peers and superior cannot help you

+ #### When
    + After doing all steps of analysis and research and still haven't found a solution.

+ #### Formulating the question
    + Be specific: try not to generalize, but try to make your question as clear as possible.
    + Check if YOU understand your question.
    + When posting code in your question: only post the relevant part that is necessary to duplicate the problem.
    + Try not to get yes or no answers.
    + Use relevant tags when you post your question online.
